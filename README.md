This is my first back-end project. I created this project using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

This web application is a simplified version of the well-known website "pastebin.com"

Within this web application, any user can create, edit and delete a paste. A paste can be created by adding a title and text content to it.
Any user can edit a paste by changing its title and/or content. The latest pastes added are visible in a list on the main page.

Functionalities:

- create a new paste
- see all latest pastes created
- edit a paste
- delete a paste

Technologies used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
